## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.



## About

This project is my submission for MLH Summer League Hackathon.
            In this simple project i decided to make a simple example with an educational goal to showcase what you can
            do with bots.
            I used Dialogflow from Google Cloud to get my first results. You can read more in general about Google Cloud
            services at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Official web site.</a>And for
            the Dialogflow service at <a href="https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Dialogflow
